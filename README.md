# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Intro
* Site Link

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. This is my third project that deals with creating a site that is responsive across different sized screens. 

**Site Link**

**Technologies Used**

For this project I worked on replacing absolute values (pixels) with relative values (%, vw, vh and fr) to make the page responsive.
I used a program called Figma to access the design brief to include the images and fonts. 

I've also used the Github pages feature to publish my site and I also used the .nojekyll empty file so that the BEM methodologies will show up on the published site.
